# Repository to store the examples of the class Analisis Masivo de datos 

# Setup
## For Python
I will recommend use the venv utility to get the versions and interpeter of python to use this repo

## For Unix Environments
```bash
source virtual_env/bin/activate

```
## For Windows Environments
CMD

```cmd
 env/Scripts/activate.bat 
```
Powershell

```ps
env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

For more information I suggest to read the follow:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

Once you finish you will need to deactivate de virtual_env

```bash
deactivate

```
